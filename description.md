A modpack including [Titanium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium), [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead), and [Tungsten](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztungsten). Modifies several core recipes. A good starting point for BZ Mods.

Note, if you already use [Very BZ](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzvery), this modpack adds nothing new.
